# Lunar-robots-mission
This repository is created to demonstrate the development process of my project - lunar robots, which, according to my idea, will be able to fully and self-sufficiently provide for sowing on the moon and create a sustainable production cycle there, which will help us, people, to colonize the moon much faster. These robots are not just another lunar rovers for studying the surface of the moon, these are real and full-fledged machines that are able to extract resources completely independently of humans, sort them, and then directly on the moon on a 3D printer print parts for a lunar base and build it from them.


he current moment of the project development, this is only 0.00001 percent of all the planned work, this is only a beta version, a truly thoughtful and good version will be created much later. At the moment you can see the first fruits of the work, namely a simulation in Pygame, where the beige square is the rover, the red one is an obstacle, and two yellow stripes are its lidars, the robot already has an obstacle avoidance algorithm, albeit primitive, also you can control it with arrow keys. That's all for now, but the project is developing very quickly, and maybe tomorrow it will be much better! 

#It sounds ambitious, but I really hope that by starting now, in a few years I will receive funding for my project.

How it seems.

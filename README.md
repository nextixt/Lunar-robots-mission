# Lunar-robots-mission
This repository is created to demonstrate the development process of my project - lunar robots, which, according to my idea, will be able to fully and self-sufficiently provide for sowing on the moon and create a sustainable production cycle there, which will help us, people, to colonize the moon much faster. These robots are not just another lunar rovers for studying the surface of the moon, these are real and full-fledged machines that are able to extract resources completely independently of humans, sort them, and then directly on the moon on a 3D printer print parts for a lunar base and build it from them.

#It sounds ambitious, but I really hope that by starting now, in a few years I will receive funding for my project.
